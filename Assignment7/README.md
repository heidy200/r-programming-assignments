### Assignment #7: Exploring R’s Object Oriented Systems ###

In this assignment, I explored R’s S3 and S4 object systems. I created examples of both types of objects, applied generic functions like print() and summary(), and inspected their structure and class to see how they differ. Using the built-in mtcars dataset, I practiced working with generic functions and documented the differences between S3 and S4 objects, including how they are defined, how their data is stored, and how methods are dispatched.
